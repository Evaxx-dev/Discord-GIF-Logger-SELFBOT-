## Info

This tool is a tool made by Eva that allows you to view every gif that is sent to you (DMs) or in a server, I made this to see what weird gifs my friends were sending, i made it in like 5 mins at 3am so its probably shit, but it works.
Thank you for using my tool :). It logs all of the GIFs to a file.
